Module "UART0"     (component AsynchroSerial)
   - UART0_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does 
                not wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the 
                preferred method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and 
                <OnBreak> the return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the 
                information about an exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be 
                read.
   - UART0_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.

Module "UART2"     (component AsynchroSerial)
   - UART2_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does 
                not wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the 
                preferred method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and 
                <OnBreak> the return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the 
                information about an exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be 
                read.
   - UART2_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.

Module "ADC0"      (component ADC)
   - ADC0_EnableEvent -Enables the <events>.
   - ADC0_DisableEvent -Disables the <events>.
   - ADC0_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - ADC0_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - ADC0_Calibrate -This method starts self calibration process. Calibration is typically used to remove the effects of the 
                gain and offset from a specific reading.

Module "TI0"       (component TimerInt)
   - TI0_EnableEvent -This method enables the events.
   - TI0_DisableEvent -This method disables the events.

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU1_SetEventMask -Enables/disables event(s). The events contained within the mask are enabled. Events not contained within 
                the mask are disabled. The component event masks are defined in the PE_Types.h file. Note: Event that are not 
                generated (See the "Events" tab in the Component inspector) are not handled by this method. In this case the 
                method returns ERR_PARAM_MASK error code. See also method <GetEventMask>.

Module "MCUC1"     (component McuLibConfig)
   - MCUC1_Init -Driver initialization method
   - MCUC1_Deinit -Driver deinitialization method

Module "Cpu"       (component MKL25Z128LK4)
