Module "ADC0"      (component ADC)
   - ADC0_EnableEvent -Enables the <events>.
   - ADC0_DisableEvent -Disables the <events>.
   - ADC0_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - ADC0_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - ADC0_Calibrate -This method starts self calibration process. Calibration is typically used to remove the effects of the 
                gain and offset from a specific reading.

Module "RTC"       (component RTC_LDD)
   - RTC_Init -Initializes the device. There are two modes of initialization.   1) RTC device is NOT battery backed up. 
                (SoftInit = FALSE)     All registers (interrupts, counters, clock routing …) that influence RTC behavior are 
                initialized.      Note: This initialization mode doesn't preserve time and date settings.   2) RTC device IS 
                battery backed up.     (SoftInit = TRUE). Only registers that are not backed up are initialized (Interrupt 
                priority …). RTC device is running, time and date a preserved, RTC interrupts (events) are preserved too.   
                Allocates memory for the device data structure.   This method can be called only once. Before the second call 
                of Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - RTC_GetTime -Returns actual time and date.    Note: Fields not supported by HW are calculated in software.
   - RTC_SetTime -Sets new time and date.   Note: All LDD_RTC_TTime structure members must be correctly filled in.

Module "TimerInt0" (component TimerInt)
   - TimerInt0_EnableEvent -This method enables the events.
   - TimerInt0_DisableEvent -This method disables the events.

Module "UART0"     (component AsynchroSerial)
   - UART0_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does 
                not wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the 
                preferred method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and 
                <OnBreak> the return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the 
                information about an exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be 
                read.
   - UART0_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.

Module "UART2"     (component AsynchroSerial)
   - UART2_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does 
                not wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the 
                preferred method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and 
                <OnBreak> the return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the 
                information about an exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be 
                read.
   - UART2_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.

Module "L293D_1_2_EN" (component PWM)
   - L293D_1_2_EN_Enable -This method enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated 
                (<DisableEvent>/<EnableEvent>).
   - L293D_1_2_EN_Disable -This method disables the component - it stops the signal generation and events calling. When the 
                timer is disabled, it is possible to call <ClrValue> and <SetValue> methods.
   - L293D_1_2_EN_SetRatio8 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as an 8-bit unsigned integer number. 0 
                - FF value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of 
                predefined values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer capabilities 
                and on the selected period.

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU1_SetEventMask -Enables/disables event(s). The events contained within the mask are enabled. Events not contained within 
                the mask are disabled. The component event masks are defined in the PE_Types.h file. Note: Event that are not 
                generated (See the "Events" tab in the Component inspector) are not handled by this method. In this case the 
                method returns ERR_PARAM_MASK error code. See also method <GetEventMask>.

Module "MCUC1"     (component McuLibConfig)
   - MCUC1_Init -Driver initialization method
   - MCUC1_Deinit -Driver deinitialization method

Module "TU2"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU2_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU2_Enable -Enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated (see SetEventMask). The 
                method is not available if the counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - TU2_Disable -Disables the component - it stops signal generation and events calling. The method is not available if the 
                counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - TU2_GetPeriodTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks before re-initialization. See also method <SetPeriodTicks>. This 
                method is available only if the property <"Counter restart"> is switched to 'on-match' value.
   - TU2_ResetCounter -Resets counter. If counter is counting up then it is set to zero. If counter is counting down then 
                counter is updated to the reload value.   The method is not available if HW doesn't allow resetting of the 
                counter.
   - TU2_GetCounterValue -Returns the content of counter register. This method can be used both if counter is enabled and if 
                counter is disabled. The method is not available if HW doesn't allow reading of the counter.
   - TU2_SetOffsetTicks -Sets the new offset value to channel specified by the parameter ChannelIdx. It is user responsibility 
                to use value below selected period. This method is available when at least one channel is configured.
   - TU2_GetOffsetTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks to compare match channel specified by the parameter ChannelIdx. 
                See also method <SetOffsetTicks>. This method is available when at least one channel is configured.
   - TU2_SelectOutputAction -Sets the type of compare match and counter overflow action on channel output. This method is 
                available when at least one channel is configured.

Module "L293D_1A"  (component BitIO)
   - L293D_1A_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory 
                or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).

Module "L293D_2A"  (component BitIO)
   - L293D_2A_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory 
                or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
